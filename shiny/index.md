## Purpose of the exercise

1. Test a model's ability to predict flower species
2. Model trained using R Iris data with a rpart tree model
3. Send in the measurements of your flower and find out its species!

--- .class #id 

## User Instruction

1. Enter the parameter on the left
2. Press submit
3. The fit shows up on the right

--- .class #id 

## Caveat and Improvements

1. The model is simplistic, but the running time is still fairly long
2. Performance and library needs to be improved
3. Try more models in the future, including random forest
