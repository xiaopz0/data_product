    "contents" : "Your Shiny Application\n\nWrite a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.\nDeploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server\nShare the application link by pasting it into the text box below\nShare your server.R and ui.R code on github\nThe application must include the following:\n\nSome form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)\nSome operation on the ui input in sever.R\nSome reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations\nYou must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.\nThe documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.\nThe Shiny application in question is entirely up to you. However, if you're having trouble coming up with ideas, you could start from the simple prediction algorithm done in class and build a new algorithm on one of the R datasets packages. Please make the package simple for the end user, so that they don't need a lot of your prerequisite knowledge to evaluate your application. You should emphasize a simple project given the short time frame.\n",
